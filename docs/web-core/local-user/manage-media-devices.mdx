# Manage Media Devices

Media devices represents the hardware for the camera, microphone and speaker
devices. To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can
use the following methods:

```js
// Get all media devices
const devices = await meeting.self.getAllDevices();

// Get all audio devices
const audioDevices = await meeting.self.getAudioDevices();

// Get all video devices
const videoDevices = await meeting.self.getVideoDevices();

// Get all speakers
const speakerDevices = await meeting.self.getSpeakerDevices();

// Get device by ID
const device = await meeting.self.getDeviceById('12345', 'audio');

// Fetch current media devices being used
const currentDevices = meeting.self.getCurrentDevices();
```

## Set device

To set a device as an active device, you can call `setDevice` method. This takes
a `MediaDeviceInfo` object, and replaces the same `kind` device.

```js
await meeting.self.setDevice(device);
```
