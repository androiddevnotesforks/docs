`DyteMeeting` component does a lot more than just providing the user interface.

It does the following things internally.

1. Keeps a mapping of components and show them according to the preset's view_type such as group_call, webinar, and livestream.
2. Provides background color, text colors and other such CSS properties.
3. Maintains states of modals, sidebars between web-core & ui-kit
4. Shifts the control bar buttons to More menu if the screen size is small.
5. Passes config, states, translation, icon packs to all child components.
6. It is the target element that gets full screened on click of full screen toggle.
7. Joins the meeting automatically if showSetupScreen is false.

The `DyteUIProvider` handles states for you. The way this works is all the individual components,
when they want to change the state, they emit the updated state partials via the `dyteStateUpdate` event.

:::info
All components sync to props passed to `DyteUIProvider` starting from UI Kit `v2.4.0`, so make sure you on the latest version.
:::

DyteUIProvider listens to this event and updates the state accordingly and then emits a `dyteStatesUpdate` event
which contains the full states object that you can use.

You can get a copy of the states object by listening to this event like so.

```jsx
import { getInitialStates, DyteUIProvider } from '@dytesdk/react-ui-kit';

function App() {
  // ...
  const [states, setStates] = useState(() => getInitialStates());

  return (
    <DyteUIProvider
      meeting={meeting}
      onDyteStatesUpdate={(e)=> {
      setStates(e.detail);
    }}>
      {/* Use the states object to update the UI */}
      {states.meeting === 'joined' && <CustomInMeetingUI />}
    </DyteUIProvider>
  );
}
```
