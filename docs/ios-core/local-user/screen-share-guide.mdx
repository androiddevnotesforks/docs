## Overview

1. Add a new Broadcast Upload Extension to your project.
2. Setup app groups.
3. Download `DyteSampleHandler` class from [Github repo](https://github.com/dyte-io/iOS-ScreenShare) .
4. Have your SampleHandler class inherited from this downloaded class `DyteSampleHandler` .
5. Update Info.plist.

### Add a new Broadcast Upload Extension to your project.

Add a Broadcast Upload Extension through `File` -> `New` -> `Target`.
Choose `iOS` -> `Broadcast Upload Extension` and fill out the required information for your extension and click `Finish`.

### Setup app groups

Add your extension to an app group by going to your extension's target in the project; in the Signings & Capabilities tab, click the + button in the top left and add App Groups. If you haven't done so already, add App Groups to your main app as well, ensuring that the App Group identifier is the same for both.

### Setup SampleHandler

- Edit your SampleHandler class to look something like this.

```swift
import ReplayKit

class SampleHandler: DyteSampleHandler {}
```

### Modify Info.plist

Make sure **both of them** (App and Extension Info.plist) contains below key.

```
  <key>RTCAppGroupIdentifier</key>
	<string>(name of the group you have created)</string>
```

Add below key inside the Info.plist of the main App.

```
<key>RTCScreenSharingExtension</key>
	<string>(Bundle Identifier of the Broadcast upload extension you have added in your project)</string>
```

### Start the Screenshare

To Launch the broadcast extension and call the method `enableScreenshare()`

```swift
dyteClient.localUser.enableScreenshare()
```

### Stop the Screenshare

To stop the ongoing screenshare and call the method `disableScreenshare()`. This will show the system
alert with a stop button for stopping screen share.

```swift
dyteClient.localUser.disbaleScreenshare()
```
