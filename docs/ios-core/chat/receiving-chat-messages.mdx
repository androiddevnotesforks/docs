# Receiving chat messages

To be able to receive chat messages you need to implement a method
`onChatUpdates()` method from callback `DyteChatEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addChatEventsListener(dyteChatEventsListener)`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteChatEventsListener {
  func onChatUpdates(messages: [DyteChatMessage]) {
  // to load chat messages
  }

  func onNewChatMessage(message: DyteChatMessage) {
    // when a new chat message is shared in the meeting
  }

  func onMessageRateLimitReset() {
    // when the rate limit for sending messages of self is reset        
  }
}
```

The `onChatUpdates()` method will be called whenever there is a change in the chat messages. The `messages` parameter is a list of `DyteChatMessage` objects that have been sent in the chat.

The `onNewChatMessage()` method will be called whenever a new chat message is shared in the meeting. The `message` parameter is a `DyteChatMessage` object that has been sent in the chat.

The `onMessageRateLimitReset()` method will be called when the rate limit for sending messages of self is reset and you can send messages again. The default rate limit is 180 messages within 60 seconds.
