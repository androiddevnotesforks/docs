# Participant Types

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. These **does not** include the local user. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```kotlin
// get all joined participants
final List<DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant> joined = dyteMobileClient.participants.active;

// get active participants
final List<DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant> active = dyteMobileClient.participants.active;
```

The `dyteMobileClient.participants` object has the following **lists** of participants

- **joined**: A list that contains all the participants who are currently in the meeting
  except the local user
- **waitlisted**: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- **active**: A list that contains all the participants, **including** the local user whose media is subscribed to i.e participants who are supposed to be on the screen at the moment, including the local user.
- **pinned**: A list that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.
- **screenShares**: A list that contains all the participants who are sharing their screen.

Therefore if you were to make a video / audio grid of participants, you'd use the `active` list, but to display the list of all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` list.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `active`, `pinned` and `screenShares` list are of type `DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant`, `waitlisted` list is of type `DyteWaitlistedParticipant`.
