Viewer participants in a stage-enabled meeting are users whose preset permission for media production is set as `canRequest`.
The `dyteMobileClient.stage` object provides APIs for viewer participants to request stage access and withdraw their join stage request.

### Request access

This method is used to create a new stage request which can be approved by the host.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.requestAccess();
```

When a host accepts the user's stage access request or allows the user directly to the stage, the SDK triggers the
`onPresentRequestReceived` callback in `DyteStageEventListener`. You can listen to this event:

```dart
class StageEventListener with DyteStageEventsListener {
  @override
  void onPresentRequestReceived() {
    // Host accepted the join stage request or invited user directly to stage
  }
}
```

### Withdraw join request

To cancel or withdraw a pending stage access request, you can call the `withdrawJoinRequest()` method:

```dart
dyteClient.stage.withdrawJoinRequest();
```
