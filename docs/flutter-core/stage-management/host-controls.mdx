In a stage management-enabled meeting, a user with the `selfPermissions.host.canAcceptStageRequests` permission as `true` is
considered a host. The `dyteMobileClient.stage` object in Dyte's Flutter Core SDK provides stage management APIs that allow hosts to
manage stage access requests, invite participants to the stage, and remove participants from the stage.

### List of Stage Access Requests

You can retrieve the list of pending stage access requests by accessing the `dyteMobileClient.stage.accessRequests` property. This property
provides a list of `DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant` objects who have requested stage access.

:::note
If the local user is not a host, this property returns an empty list.

### Grant stage access

A privileged user can grant access to stage for a set of users with `grantAccess` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.grantAccess(peer);
```

To grant access to all stage requests at a time, you can user `grantAccessToAll()` method. This method takes no parameters.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.grantAccessToAll();
```

### Deny stage access

A privileged user can deny access to stage for a set of users with `denyAccess` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.denyAccess(peer);
```

To deny all stage requests at a time, you can user `denyAccessToAll()` method. This method takes no parameters.

```dart
dyteClient.stage.denyAccessToAll();
```

### Kick participant from stage

A privileged user can kick a participant from stage with `kick` method.

| **Parameters** | **Type**                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| peer           | _DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant_ |

```dart
dyteClient.stage.kick(peer);
```

### Listening to Stage Access Requests

You can listen to incoming stage access requests or changes in the access requests list if you are a host. The SDK provides the
following callbacks to `DyteStageEventsListener`:

```dart
class StageEventListener extends DyteStageEventsListener {
  @override
  void onPresentRequestAdded(DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant) {
    // Called when a participant requests to join the stage. Triggered only if the local user is a host.
  }

  @override
  void onPresentRequestClosed(DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant) {
    // Called when a participant with a pending stage access request leaves the meeting.
    // Triggered only if the local user is a host.
  }

  @override
  void onPresentRequestRejected(DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant) {
    // Called when a participant's stage access request is denied by the host.
    // Triggered only if the local user is a host.
  }

  @override
  void onPresentRequestWithdrawn(DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant participant) {
    // Called when a participant cancels their stage access request.
    // Triggered only if the local user is a host.
  }

  @override
  void onStageRequestsUpdated(List<DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant> accessRequests) {
      // Called when the list of stage access requests is updated.
  }
}
```

You need to attach the listener to meeting client as follows:

```dart
dyteClient.addStageEventsListener(StageEventsListener())
```

These APIs enable you to manage stage access requests and participants effectively in Dyte meetings. Next, we'll explore the
Stage APIs available to Viewer participants.
