# Recording

The `dyteClient.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting.

### Recording State

The `dyteClient.recording.recordingState` property indicates the current state of the recording. Possible states include `idle`, `recording`, `starting`, `stopping`.

### Start a recording

To start a recording, you need to call the `start()` method in the
`dyteClient.recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.recording.start();
```

### Stop a recording

To stop a recording, you need to call the `stop()` method in the
`dyteClient.recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.recording.stop();
```

### Listening for Recording Events

To handle recording-related updates, you need to listen for
`onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated()` event. This returns `DyteRecordingState`
object with it.

### Listen to recording state changes

To handle recording-related updates, you need to implement `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. This interface provides callbacks for various recording events as described in excerpt below:

- `onMeetingRecordingStarted()`: Called when the recording is started or resumed, either by the user or their peer.
- `onMeetingRecordingEnded()`: Called when the recording is stopped or paused, either by the user or their peer.
- `onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(DyteRecordingState` recordingState): Notifies when there is a change in the recording state.
- `onMeetingRecordingStopError(String error)`: Indicates an error occurred while stopping an active recording.
- `onMeetingRecordingPauseError(String error)`: Indicates an error occurred while pausing an active recording.
- `onMeetingRecordingResumeError(String error)`: Indicates an error occurred while resuming a paused recording.

```dart

class RecordingListener with DyteRecordingEventsListener {

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
    /// Handle starting of recording
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(DyteRecordingState recordingState) {
    /// Handle status update of recording
  }

   @override
  void onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
    /// Handle recording ended
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRecordingStopError(String error) {
    /// Handle recording error
  }

}

```

You can subscribe to this events by `addRecordingListener` method:

```dart
dyteClient.addRecordingListener(RecordingListener());
```
