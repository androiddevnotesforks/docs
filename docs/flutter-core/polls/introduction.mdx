# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `dyteClient.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`dyteClient.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting,
where each element is an object of type `DytePollMessage`.

```dart
class DytePollMessage {
  final String id;
  final String question;
  final bool anonymous;
  final bool hideVotes;
  final String createdBy;
  final List<DytePollOption> options;
  final List<String> voted;
}
```

The `DytePollMessage` class has the following properties:

- `id`: Unique ID assigned to each poll.
- `question`: Question of the poll.
- `anonymous`: To hide the votes of each user even after completion. (false by
  default)
- `hideVotes`: Hide votes until the voting is complete. (enabled if anonymous is
  enabled)
- `createdBy`: Name of creator the poll.
- `options`: Array of `DytePollOption` object, contains all the options to the
  poll question.

The type `DytePollMessage` represents a poll in a Dyte meeting. It also
contains list of `DytePollOption` which are _options_ for a given poll. And every
`DytePollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`DytePollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

```dart
class DytePollOption(
  final String text;   // Option text.
  final List<DytePollVote> votes;   // List of votes.
  final int count;    // Number of votes.
);

class DytePollVote {
  final String id;    // ID of the voter.
  final String name;  // Name of the voter.
}
```

### Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `DytePollEventsListener`:

To get poll updates, listen to `onPollUpdates()` callback:

```dart

class PollEventsListeners extends DytePollEventsListener {

  @override
  void onPollUpdates(List<DytePollMessage> polls) {
    /// code to handle polls
  }

  @override
  void onNewPoll(DytePollMessage poll) {
    /// code to handle new poll
  }

}

```

You can subscribe to these events as follows:

```dart
dyteClient.addPollEventsListener(PollEventsListeners());
```
