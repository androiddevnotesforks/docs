# Media Permissions

To get media permissions (audio/video) for localUser we can do as follows

```dart
final isCameraPermissionGranted
  = dyteMobileClient.localUser.permissions.isCameraPermissionGranted;
final isMicrophonePermissionGranted
  = dyteMobileClient.localUser.permissions.isMicrophonePermissionGranted;
```

Similarly to listen to callbacks regarding media permissions once user joins
the meeting

```dart

class LocalUserNotifier implements DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...
  @override
  void onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutCameraPermission() {
    // when meeting room is joined without camera permission
  }

  override
  void onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutMicPermission() {
    // when meeting room is joined without microphone permission
  }

  ...
}
```
